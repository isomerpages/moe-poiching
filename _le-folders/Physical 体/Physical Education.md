### Purpose and Goals of Physical Education

The purpose of physical education is to enable students to demonstrate individually and with others the physical skills, practices, and values to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living. Physical education is about movement. Movement is fundamental and essential to life, work and play. Movement competency facilitates participation and allows individuals to derive pleasure and satisfaction from physical activities. An individual who can move proficiently has the skills and knowledge related to movement and values purposeful moving for life. Physical education, therefore, is responsible for helping students take on the responsibility of learning by providing them with the capacity to make reasoned and wise choices through a lifelong process of change. Physical education teachers consciously make use of movement as the primary medium to reach and teach the whole child through the following three modes:

*   education in movement;
*   education through movement; and
*   education about movement
