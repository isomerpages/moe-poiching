To develop our students to be confident communicators, we introduced EL Speech and Drama training into our P3 and P4 programmes in 2018 as part of our PCS Active Learning.

All students are given a role in their class plays and they learn to work as a team during this enriching production experience as well. Through these targeted programmes, we hope our student can find joy in learning as well!

Our P3 students have been performing live for parents and their juniors in P2 since 2018!
