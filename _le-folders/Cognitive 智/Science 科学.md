### Introduction

Our department aims to provide students with experiences which build on their interest and stimulate their curiosity about their environment. We seek to nurture the student as an inquirer while the teacher acts as a facilitator in the process, generating enriching classroom discussions. This would then help pupils appreciate how Science influences people and the environment around us.
