ALP in Poi Ching School aims to nurture innovation and creativity to prepare our children for the future. Our ALP programmes bring learning beyond the classroom as students are given opportunities to use what they learn in the classroom in real world context. The English and Chinese Departments are the main drivers of nurturing students as effective bilingual communicators through level-wide programmes.

In 2023, the Chinese & English language departments planned various ALP programmes for students from different levels to make the learning of Chinese and English languages more effective and meaningful. Students were engaged in real life application of both languages and produced quality deliverables which showcased their competency and confidence.

**P1 and P2 Chinese Speech and Drama**

Through Chinese Speech and Drama lessons, the lower primary students were exposed to various themes and text types such as poems, fables, choral pieces and dialect songs. They practised basic oracy skills such as enunciation, tone, volume and pitch, learning how to use their voice with expression for the Speech and Drama performances.
