ALP in Poi Ching School aims to nurture innovation and creativity to prepare our children for the future. Our ALP programmes bring learning beyond the classroom as students are given opportunities to use what they learn in the classroom in real world context. The English and Chinese Departments are the main drivers of nurturing students as effective bilingual communicators through level-wide programmes.

In 2023, the Chinese & English language departments planned various ALP programmes for students from different levels to make the learning of Chinese and English languages more effective and meaningful. Students were engaged in real life application of both languages and produced quality deliverables which showcased their competency and confidence.

**P1 and P2 Chinese Speech and Drama**

Through Chinese Speech and Drama lessons, the lower primary students were exposed to various themes and text types such as poems, fables, choral pieces and dialect songs. They practised basic oracy skills such as enunciation, tone, volume and pitch, learning how to use their voice with expression for the Speech and Drama performances. 

**P3 Chinese Group Story Telling**

The P3 students were exposed to various themes and text types through Chinese group story telling lessons. They learnt the basics of storytelling, how to project their voice and the importance of collaboration. Through practice and perseverance, the students were able to build confidence in using Chinese language.

**P4 English Language Speech & Drama Programme**

At the P4 level, our students went through a curated Speech and Drama programme where they were introduced to the basics of acting and stage production. Our students learnt the foundations of proper speech, enunciation, tone, volume and pitch as applied in various forms of dramatic expression. They were also exposed to the various themes and text types such as poems, fables, short stories, plays and choral pieces.

**P5 Chinese Young Reporters & English Language Public Speaking Programme**

A group of P5 students were chosen to participate in the Chinese Young Reporters programme where they learnt basic reporting skills, critical thinking and analytical skills as well as effective communication skills. At the end of the programme, these students put what they have learnt into practice when they recorded interviews for the National Calligraphy Competition and Mid-Autumn Festival celebration.

The English Language Public Speaking Programme equipped our students with the skills to present in front of an audience, using the language that is appropriate to audience, setting and occasion. They were taught to express their views and opinions appropriately and confidently which helped to develop their social interaction skills. The students were challenged to write and present their own speech based on a given topic at the end of the programme.

**P6 Chinese Vlogging Workshop**

Keeping up with online and social media trends, the CL department introduced students to a Chinese vlogging workshop where students learnt the basic techniques of social media content writing, video-making and post-production for vlogging. Students filmed and edited their vlogs in school, interviewed schoolmates and teachers, added voiceovers and subtitles in Chinese, and created creative vlogs which displayed their language skills and interdisciplinary competencies.
