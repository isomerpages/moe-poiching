**Learning for Life Programme – D’ARTS@PCS 3E Framework:**

D’ARTS@PCS aims to help students:  <br>
D – Discover strengths and interests  <br>
‘&nbsp; – (The apostrophe is used to indicate possession of the Arts by the students)  <br>
A – Acquire a sense of empathy and care  <br>
R – Respect diversity and appreciate our multi-cultural heritage  <br>
T – To develop artistic expression  <br>
S – Sharpen their social skills

In line with the aims of LLP to broaden and deepen the learning of our students to prepare them for life, our LLP leverages on the vibrant Arts culture in Poi Ching and expand the number of opportunities and platforms for moulding the character of students through a wider scope of musical and performing arts experiences. D’ARTS@PCS builds upon existing platforms and processes such as the PCS Arts Education framework, General Music Programme, Visual and Performing Arts CCA and PAL, and takes into consideration our school’s unique culture and resources.

Being an SAP school means that our students have fewer opportunities to mix with students from other races and may also not be as familiar with other cultures compared with students from mainstream schools. An exposure to varied programmes from different cultural groups heightens cultural awareness and instils respect and tolerance for diversity. Values and attitudes acquired through experiential learning are likely to sink deeper than those learnt in the classroom. Being a Dance niche school, we are also equipped with 2 dance rooms which we hope to continue to fully utilized with our proposed LLP.
