<p>The SAP programme of Poi Ching School is designed to deliver meaningful
bicultural education, premised on national education and SAP school ethos,
in alignment with the SAP Schools’ Strategy Plan and our School Vision
‘Rooted and future-ready SAPlings for Singapore’.</p>
<p>We provide learning experiences that integrate multicultural content into
our curriculum and co-curriculum through Chinese Cultural Festive activities
and signature SAP Flagship Programmes (Speech &amp; Drama, Wushu, Chinese
Opera, Chinese Orchestra, Chinese Festive Drum, Chinese Calligraphy &amp;
Chinese Brush Painting) that are being conducted during Chinese, PE, Music
and Art lessons. In addition, we have sustainable social mixing partnerships
with local schools, whereby selected groups of students are given opportunities
to interact with students of different ethnic groups and to develop their
social and personal awareness and interaction skills. To establish strong
national identity amongst our students, besides conducting Conversation
Malay Programme for all P3 to P6 students, we provided Malay Cultural eXposure
Programme for the P3 to P4 students to further enhance their appreciation
to the Malay Traditional Cultural in the learning of Dikir Barat and Silat.</p>
<p>Beyond the shores, we heighten our students' awareness pertaining to global
concerns through having connections with The Singapore Japanese School
and several overseas education institutions, for example, Indonesia, Thailand,
Hong Kong and Suzhou China. Besides hosting the foreign students, we provide
platforms for selected groups of P5 students to embark on overseas trips
to Hong Kong for P5 BiCEP students and to Malacca for selected P5 students
as well as to conduct virtual overseas experiential learning for the whole
of our P3 and P4 cohort, aiming to cultivate a sense of global outlook
among our students.</p>
