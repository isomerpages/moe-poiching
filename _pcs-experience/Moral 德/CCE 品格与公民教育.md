### Vision

To nurture morally upright and concerned citizens

### CCE Outcomes


Persons of good character and are concerned citizens

### Introduction

n Poi Ching, CCE is integrated with academic, co-curricular programmes, CCA. VIA, Student Leadership Development, Bamboo Programme, SAP Flagship and other school programmes as shown in the CCE Framework. &nbsp;In this way, CCE is lived authentically as part of the school experience of our students. Through CCE, Poi Ching aims to nurture morally upright and concerned citizens by inculcating values and build SE competencies in our students. This in turn will develop them into persons of good character and concerned citizens in this fast changing and globalised world, as reflected in our school’s CCE Vision and Outcomes.

### Pedagogy/Approach  

**Head, Heart and Hands**


To support this framework, the school has adopted the Head, Heart and Hands framework (from NE), to give our students a greater focus in engaging and empowering them to make a positive impact from themselves and their family, the school and to community (nation). In engaging the HEAD, we want our students to think through and arrive at a deeper understanding of what it means to be a Poi Ching student and Singaporean. In engaging the HEART, we want our students to connect emotionally with Singapore and have a deeper sense of belonging to the school, community and nation. Finally in engaging the HANDS, we want our students to give back to the school, community and nation.

A customised approach in meeting STG3 (Pupils have a sense of identity: from school to community to nation to the world) is to leverage on the existing platforms which we already have and the 3 BIG domains of self and family, school and community. Our teachers take ownership of their own professional growth to nurture in students the competencies required for the 21st Century and through the immersion and participation of these programmes, teachers can bring out the “STAR” within them. To achieve the desired CCE outcome and vision, the school promotes the social, emotional and mental well-being of all students through a culture of care that permeates the whole school, guidance curriculum for all students, and additional intervention for students at risk.

**Commemorating World Mental Health Day**

![](/images/Slide1-4.jpg)

**World Mental Health Day**&nbsp;is an initiative by World Health Organisation. It is observed globally on&nbsp;**10 October every year**&nbsp;with the aims of raising awareness of mental health issues and synergising efforts to promote positive mental well-being. Poi Ching School supports the global World Mental Health Day initiative this October by focusing on Positive Emotions and Positive Relationships with the theme of&nbsp;_**“Do Good, Feel Good, Spread Good”**_.

We encourage our students to recognise and exercise their strengths, build on positive emotions like hope, compassion, gratitude and pride, as well as to actively contribute to their family and community. With a virtuous cycle of positive relationships reinforcing their experiences of positive emotions, this not only helps to strengthen their resilience and stress coping capacity, but also enhances their mental well-being. The attached video and slides provide some ways to put to practice positive well-being.
