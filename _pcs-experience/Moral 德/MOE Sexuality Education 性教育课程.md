<h4><strong>Moe Sexuality Education in Schools</strong><br></h4>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education
(SEd) in schools aims to enable students to understand the physiological,
social and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy
and rewarding relationships with others, including those with members of
the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on
sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the family as the
basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages
and stable nuclear family units with extended family support. The teaching
and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and beliefs of the
different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Goals</strong> of
Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>(a) Support students in managing their physiological, social and emotional
changes as they grow up and develop safe and healthy relationships.
<br>(b) Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on
sexuality matters.
<br>(c) Help students develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and
others by having positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality
that are premised on the family as the basic unit of society.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of
Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love and respect
yourself as you love and respect others;
<br>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Build positive
relationships based on love and respect (which are the foundation for strong
families);
<br>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make responsible
decisions for yourself, your family and society; and
<br>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abstinence before
marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and unintended pregnancies.
<br>Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved ones.

<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Sexuality Education Lessons</u></strong>:</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The upper primary years
mark the onset of puberty. With better nutrition and improved health care,
children are reaching puberty at a younger age and have to grapple with
physical, emotional and psychological changes in themselves. The implication
is that our children are becoming biologically ready for sexual activity
sooner without necessarily having the corresponding cognitive or emotional
maturity to modulate their behaviours. Furthermore, our young are also
exposed to a wide range of influences that could endanger health and undermine
the integrity of the family. Our students require close guidance so that
they can respond with discernment to the sexual messages in the media and
other sources.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education (SEd)
lessons are taught as part of CCE (FTGP) at Primary 5 and 6. Through these
lessons, students will learn healthy ways to manage the physiological,
social and emotional changes in their growing years. They learn to build
healthy and rewarding relationships with others, including those with members
of the opposite sex. Students are also guided to make wise, informed and
responsible decisions to keep themselves safe from sexuality-related risks.</p>
<p><strong>At Poi Ching School, the following Sexuality Education lessons will be taught in&nbsp;2024:</strong>
