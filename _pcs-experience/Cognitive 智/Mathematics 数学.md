### Vision

Students are equipped with the necessary Mathematical knowledge skills, are developed in their thinking process and apply what they have acquired in life

### Mission

To develop students’ confidence in using mathematics and perseverance in solving a problem

Main Pedagogy/Teaching Strategies  

### C-P-A Approach


C-P-A stands for Concrete, Pictorial and Abstract. Concrete components include manipulatives like fraction discs, linking cubes etc. are used to solve the problems. Pictorial representatives include drawings, graphs or diagrams which students read and interpret the information. Abstract refers to symbolic representations such as numbers and letters.

C-P-A approach is to cater to students of diverse learning styles eg. visual, kinesthetic. Using CPA approach, all students especially those with difficulties in Mathematics will be able to process the new learning or concepts in a gradual progression from 3D to 2D objects and finally to symbols where they have experienced Mathematics in various forms.

### Key Programmes

Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM)

Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) is a resource-based support aimed at providing intervention for some Primary 1 students who need help in basic numeracy skills. Students are identified through a screening test at the beginning of Term 1.

LSM is implemented in Poi Ching School since January 2007.

A trained LSM teacher conducts the lessons in a fun and engaging manner to motivate LSM students to gain confidence in the subject of Mathematics.

**Excellence 2000 (E2K) Mathematics Programme**

E2K is an inquiry-based programme which targeting at P4 to P6 high-ability students. It is first implemented in 2015, mainly focusing at P4 high-ability students. It aims to develop the skills like Mathematical Thinking, Mathematical Communication and Collaboration Skills. The level of depth and difficulty builds up each unit progress. Story, games and puzzles are used to engage the students in problem solving.

**Mathematics Olympiad Training Programme**

This programme provides the students with an opportunity to stimulate logical and creative thinking and also develop higher order problem solving skills. P4 to P6 students who have interests and are strong in Mathematics will be invited to participate. It also helps to prepare the students for various Mathematics Olympiad competitions.
