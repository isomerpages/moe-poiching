### Vision

To be a vibrant and influential hub of creativity, where visual and performing arts converge to ignite imagination, foster cultural understanding, and inspire societal change. We envision a future where our department sets the standard for artistic expression, promoting self-confidence and well-being through the transformative power of aesthetics. With unwavering dedication to artistic excelllence, inclusivity, and collaboration, we aim to enrich lives, challenge perceptions, and cultivate a world where the arts are at the heart of human expression and connection.

### Mission

To cultivate a dynamic and inclusive environment where creativity, innovation, and artistic exploration flourish. Our department strives to enrich the cultural landscape by producing exceptional visual and performing arts, encouraging critical discourse, and inspiring positive change in our community and beyond. We aim to empower individuals to embrace and express their unique aesthetic sensibilities while contributing to the enrichment of culture and society through the transformative power of aesthetics.

In Poi Ching, we also hope to provide an enriching broad-based experience for our students and have planned these authentic art experiences to compliment our curriculum:

### Key Programmes


**Visual Art**

The Visual Art Curriculum is structured based on Art Forms as we want to give our students the exposure to a wide variety of art forms so that they can explore and discover their interests. Students are also taught Art Theory such as the Elements and Principles of Design as well as Feldman’s approach to art criticism so that students have the vocabulary and skills discuss artworks.

**Music**

The Music Curriculum is structured to provide our students with the opportunity to explore a wide range of instruments and learn to use these instruments to express and communicate. &nbsp;Principles of music specific pedagogies such as Kodaly, Dalcroze and Orff are also used in the teaching of music concepts. In Poi Ching, our students also develop an awareness and appreciation of local and global cultures through music.

### To our Learning For Life Programme (LLP):

**Learning for Life Programme – D’ARTS@PCS 3E Framework:**

![](/images/LLP.jpg)

D’ARTS@PCS aims to help students:  <br>
D – Discover strengths and interests  <br>
‘&nbsp; – (The apostrophe is used to indicate possession of the Arts by the students)  <br>
A – Acquire a sense of empathy and care  <br>
R – Respect diversity and appreciate our multi-cultural heritage  <br>
T – To develop artistic expression  <br>
S – Sharpen their social skills

In line with the aims of LLP to broaden and deepen the learning of our students to prepare them for life, our LLP leverages on the vibrant Arts culture in Poi Ching and expand the number of opportunities and platforms for moulding the character of students through a wider scope of musical and performing arts experiences. D’ARTS@PCS builds upon existing platforms and processes such as the PCS Arts Education framework, General Music Programme, Visual and Performing Arts CCA and PAL, and takes into consideration our school’s unique culture and resources.

Being an SAP school means that our students have fewer opportunities to mix with students from other races and may also not be as familiar with other cultures compared with students from mainstream schools. An exposure to varied programmes from different cultural groups heightens cultural awareness and instils respect and tolerance for diversity. Values and attitudes acquired through experiential learning are likely to sink deeper than those learnt in the classroom. Being a Dance niche school, we are also equipped with 2 dance rooms which we hope to continue to fully utilized with our proposed LLP.

### Exposure: Broad-Based Curriculum for All

Under the broad-based curriculum, all students go through an enhanced Music and Performing Arts modules. These modules are carefully selected in a deliberate attempt to promote social cohesion through the appreciation of our multi-cultural society. They are also selected for their ability to provide students with real-life experiential learning to develop their character and values, cultivate positive attitudes, self-expression and strengthen their people skills. During the art and music curriculum, students will also be taught a modified version of Feldman’s Method of Critical Inquiry. These are a set of effective questioning strategies to initiate verbal interaction that encourages reasoning, critical thinking resulting in positive learning outcomes.

### Experience: Authentic Experiences for Many

**Assembly Talks and Enrichments**

Under authentic experiences, we bring in high quality arts performances during assembly. Lower primary students will also have Performing Arts CCA workshops such as Introduction to Band and Chinese Orchestra. Performing Arts CCA also incorporate different cultural elements into their 30 week CCA program. For example, that can include cultural specific pieces/works in the repertoire that students learn in their CCA. The first-hand experience of learning, interpreting, improvising, presenting and performing a culturally different piece will allow students to delve deeper into the historical and cultural context of a specific culture.

**Performing Arts CCA**

All the Performing Arts modules culminate into a performance at the end of each term during the Aesthetics week or during school events. Venues such as the stage in the library, dance rooms, art gallery, school hall will be opened to the students for various arts events/ performances. The Performing Arts CCA leaders will also be given the opportunity to plan and spearhead the Aesthetics week and assembly showcases. Students who have been identified to have an aptitude or an interest can book a slot to perform to their friends during the 3 recesses. Ultimately, such student led projects will serve as an excellent platform for the Performing Arts CCA leaders to exercise their leadership skills, improve on relationship management and confidence building.

**Authentic Learning Journeys**

For the P4-P6 students, we have arranged for them to go on authentic learning journeys to various arts related venues for an aesthetic experience. An integral part of these learning journeys is the understanding of what concert/museum etiquette entails. Concert/Museum etiquette refers to a set of polite behaviour expected of concert goers/visitors. To make the experience more meaningful, teachers will provide more in-depth information about the art forms the students are experiencing so that they can see the relevance in the real world. Pre and post activities will also be conducted so as to gather feedback for review and to consolidate the students’ learning after the visit.

### Excellence: Talent Development for Some

In the final tier of D’ARTS@PCS, we cater to the needs of high achievers in the Arts. The exceptional talents in Performing Arts will be identified for external talent development programmes organised by various Arts organisations (SOTA, NAC, WBAS) and MOE-CCAB (MTDC). This provides students with opportunities to train with the best of the best. As iron sharpens iron, the takeaways from this specialised talent programmes are invaluable to the special few.

We also require these high achievers to do service learning, integrating meaningful community service with instruction and reflection to enrich the learning experience, teach civic responsibility, and strengthen communities. Given their talent, these students should not stop at product, but to use their talent to bless the community. Their annual projects will be focused on service to community, through charity showcases/ productions/ exhibitions to bring joy to the young, old or less fortunate.
