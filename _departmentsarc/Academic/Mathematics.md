### Vision

Students are equipped with the necessary Mathematical knowledge skills, are developed in their thinking process and apply what they have acquired in life

### Mission

To develop students’ confidence in using mathematics and perseverance in solving a problem.


### Key Programmes

Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM)

Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) is a resource-based support aimed at providing intervention for some Primary 1 students who need help in basic numeracy skills. Students are identified through a screening test at the beginning of Term 1.

LSM is implemented in Poi Ching School since January 2007.

A trained LSM teacher conducts the lessons in a fun and engaging manner to motivate LSM students to gain confidence in the subject of Mathematics.

**LSM Games Day 2018**&nbsp;

On 27th July 2018, our school organised LSM Games Day. We invited pupils from White Sands Primary School, Fengshan Primary School and Angsana Primary School. It was a collaborative effort of LSM teachers from these schools to create a positive mathematical learning experience through play.

7 stations were set up to create meaningful mathematical experiences.

The students truly enjoyed them.

Together, we instilled the JOY of Learning.

**Financial Literacy**

Financial Literacy is an entrepreneurship training which aims to prepare all students to be financially savvy and responsible leaders. Students are equipped with the basic tools, knowledge and values on financial management. Students will experience in exercising judgment, risk evaluation and real-world problem solving. A platform will be provided at P6 for students to ideate, design and display their entrepreneur skills and teamwork in planning and managing the fund raising activity.

**Excellence 2000 (E2K) Mathematics Programme**

E2K is an inquiry-based programme which targeting at P4 to P6 high-ability students. It is first implemented in 2015, mainly focusing at P4 high-ability students. It aims to develop the skills like Mathematical Thinking, Mathematical Communication and Collaboration Skills. The level of depth and difficulty builds up each unit progress. Story, games and puzzles are used to engage the students in problem solving.

**Mathematics Olympiad Training Programme**

This programme provides the students with an opportunity to stimulate logical and creative thinking and also develop higher order problem solving skills. P4 to P6 students who have interests and are strong in Mathematics will be invited to participate. It also helps to prepare the students for various Mathematics Olympiad competitions.

**Mathematics Monitors at Work!**

The Maths’ Monitors were selected based on their ability to interact with students who utilised the Mathematics corner‘s activities during recess. Their role is to act as a buddy and infuse Mathematical strategies to make learning fun.
