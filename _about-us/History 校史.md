Poi Ching School was founded in 1919 by the late Reverend Canon Guok Koh Muo（郭可模） as a Chinese-medium school at Victoria Street. In 1924, due to financial difficulties, the Futsing Association took over the management of the school and shifted the school from Victoria Street to its office in Queen Street.

In 1958, the school became a Government-aided school. In 1970, Poi Ching School moved from Queen Street to Toa Payoh. In 1992, the school was selected as a Special Assistance Plan (SAP) School by the Ministry of Education to offer English and Chinese as first languages.

In 2000, Poi Ching School moved from Toa Payoh to its present premises at Tampines Street 71. In 2008, the school started its Bi-Cultural Programme. In 2014, the school completed on-site PERI upgrading where a 7-storey teaching block was built. In 2015, Poi Ching School went single-session with the inclusion of a Student Care Centre to cater to the needs of the working parents.

Poi Ching School was accorded Learning for Life Programme in D’ARTS@PCS.
