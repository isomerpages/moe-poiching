**后疫情时代的学习体验**

尊敬的家长们：

        突如其来的冠状病毒席卷全世界，也为我们的教育带来前所未见的挑战。短短两年，我们经历了几次居家学习，同时校园里的日常作息也因为各种安全管理措施而起了巨大的变化。在应对挑战之余，我们也应该积极地为后疫情时代做准备，并把握现在、放眼未来，为将来的教育新方向规划。

        早在许多年前，当老师让同学们想象：“未来的学校和学习方式跟今天会有什么不同？” 一个很普遍的想法就是：学习不再局限于课堂和书本，莘莘学子随时随地都可以学习，学习的机会和场所也无处不在。同学们说他们不用上学，在家也可以学习。他们可以上线，在线上跟老师互动，也可以从线上搜寻资料，自主学习。他们也可以在虚拟的课堂上跟来自世界各地的人士交流，互相切磋。学习和交流不再局限于时间和空间，而这个想法今天已经实现了！

        后疫情时代，教育也起了变化，学校要如何应对呢？

1.  **巩固知识与技能**

        新加坡国立大学校长，陈永财教授在一篇访谈中分享，他认为学生应该拥有好奇心、创造力，能够串点成线，连线成面，并且具有自我意识，懂得如何做人和做事，将来才能够在社会上立足。我很赞同他的说法。在未来的社会，许多工作将会是跨学科、融合了许多不同的知识与技能，懂得如何把不同的知识和技能串联起来，让学习更全面，才能够帮助学生对各种课题有更深入的了解。学生今日所学在他们踏入职场的时候也许已经不适用了，因此学习必须紧跟着时代的脚步，精益求精。我们的教育在着重学术与数码知识之余，更要注重培养软技能，教会学生怎么做人，做起事来才会事半功倍。

        在来临的新一年，学校也将在日常课程内融入更多软技能的学习。譬如：

*   加强沟通技能，通过深化价值观的学习，帮助学生在多元文化中懂得用不同的视角来开启坦诚的对话，尊重他人的看法。
*   强化同侪互助的精神，建立正面的人际关系。制造更多小组协作的平台让同学们共同学习，互补互助。

2. **加强心理建设**

        许多人认为现今的学生是草莓族，很娇贵，也很脆弱，受不起打击。两年的疫情的确也打断了学生的正常学习常规与节奏，无法预知的局势发展给孩子们带来焦虑。如果要帮助学生面向未来，应对挑战，建立他们的心理韧性，以及重视他们的心理健康， 也将是我们应该更加重视的。面对变幻莫测的未来，学生需具备适应能力，能够灵活地从不同的角度观察与思考，跳脱现有的框框，更好地掌握局势才不会临阵乱了手脚而造成心理压力。

        老师们将通过坦诚的对话和辅导课加强学生对自己心理健康的认识，鼓励学生勇敢地面对本身的问题，学会向周遭关心他的人求助。
				
3.  **改变学习模式**

        经历过疫情的洗礼，我们认识到学习模式必须随时改变以适应新的需求，学校的作业方式也要与时并进。结合课堂上课和居家学习的混合式学习模式很快就要开启了，这个学习模式要求学生拥有自律能力，自我掌控居家学习的进度和步伐，同时也要跟上老师在课堂中的教学，两方面都必须应付自如。

        通过这个模式，我们希望同学们能成为自主学习者， 毕业后也继续保有终身学习的热忱。

        教育部长陈振声指出，在后冠病的新世界，我们的学生需有“三个层面的信心”。这包括有信心在全球化的世界竞争，有自信地认同自我和有自信地主导前程。显而易见，要在后疫情时代站稳脚步，自信是少不了的。培养孩子们的自信心不是从书本中学习，而是通过人际交流与互动来形成的。学校必须有意识地拨出课时来进行这项重要的任务。教育工作任重道远，小学阶段更是建立稳固基础的黄金时期。学习不单为一张文凭，树立良好品格与建设强大的内心更为重要。 希望家长们与学校携手同心，为我们的孩子们创建一个帮助他们健康成长的学习环境与氛围。

        祝愿大家2022 年健康、平安！

**Learning Post-Covid**

 Dear Parents

        As Covid-19 swept the world seemingly out of nowhere, it brought unprecedented changes to the way we live and learn. In a short span of two years, we have experienced multiple occasions of Home-Based Learning (HBL), and adhered to extraordinary Safe Management Measures in school, turning once familiar school routines into a litany of novel experiences. We have come far though, adapting well to the “new normal”. Yet, in overcoming present challenges presented by the pandemic, let’s not forget to prepare for a post-Covid future, and ready ourselves for things to come. 

        Some years back, when our teachers got our students to envision how schools and learning of the future would differ from the present, a relatively common image surfaced. Students envisioned learning would no longer be confined to classrooms and books, and could happen anywhere and at any time. They would not have to be physically present in school to learn, and could do so in the comfort of their homes. They could go online to meet their teachers, do research on the World Wide Web, and learn independently. They could also be members of virtual classrooms, global in scale, interacting and learning alongside international peers. Learning and interactions would no longer be limited by space and time. 

        At this point, you would realise that elements of this futuristic vision are already here in our present lives. Perhaps Covid has brought education into the future. It has certainly taught us many lessons. Yet, the pandemic will pass, and we will have to consider the following imperatives, learning and living in a post-Covid world.
				
1. **Cohering Disciplines and the Importance of Soft Skills**

        Professor Tan Eng Chye, president of the National University of Singapore, once shared in an interview his view of the qualities a student should possess to thrive in society. He shared that one should have a lively curiosity, creativity, the intellectual capacity to connect the dots, and possess self and social awareness. I could not agree more with his view. 

        It is increasingly clear that the jobs of tomorrow will be interdisciplinary, requiring knowledge and skills across a gamut of domains. Being able to draw coherent linkages among seemingly diverse disciplines and subjects, and apply knowledge and skills gained across one’s whole learning experience will put a student in good stead to flourish. As we teach the academic aspect of education, as important – or perhaps even more important – would be the development of soft skills and character building. The academic knowledge may not always be relevant when students step forth into the world of work. But with soft skills, good character traits, and a positive learning disposition, one would be ready to face the future, regardless of its challenges. 

     In 2022, our school will be further integrating soft skills into our daily learning experiences, to achieve the following:

*   Enhanced socio-emotional competencies, especially communication and empathy. Through our values education programme, our students will learn perspective-taking in conversations, and to respect the opinions of others in frank discourse.
*   Strengthened peer support and camaraderie. With more opportunities for smallgroup activities and discussion, our students will develop stronger and more positive interpersonal relationships, growing and learning together with their peers.

2. **Mental Resilience**

      It is common opinion that students of today are the “strawberry generation”, or a fruit that connotes preciousness, fragility and weakness. The pandemic years have taken a toll on us all, strawberry or otherwise, disrupting routines and throwing the future into uncertainty. As we prepare our students for the future, building up their mental resilience is key, and will be our focus as a school. In facing a volatile and uncertain future, our students will need to be adaptable and nimble in thinking. They will need to quickly assess problems from multiple perspectives to derive solutions. And they will sometimes have to escape the confines of convention to do so. Only with this adaptability and mental resilience will they be able to face challenges, regardless of what they are, and not crumble under pressure and stress.

       Our teachers will be imparting skills to our students for self-care, engaging them in conversation to better develop mental resilience, and instil in them the awareness of the availability of help should they so require it.

3. **Blended Learning**

        The pandemic has taught us the importance of adaptability. With HBL, we have experienced a transformation of the age-old learning model in school, and adapted to it. In time, blended learning, a combination of in-person classes in school and HBL, will be implemented. Self-directedness and discipline factor strongly in this learning model, empowering students with the independence to control their learning progress both in and out of school. We trust our students will be self-directed learners and continue to adopt a positive ‘learning for life’ attitude through this transformation, and even after they graduate.  

        Education Minister Chan Chun Sing said that there are three dimensions of confidence that our students should have – the confidence to chart their own paths; the confidence in accepting themselves – assured of their ability to bounce back from failure or adversity; and a confidence to compete in a more globalised world. Confidence, clearly, is key. Imbuing confidence in our students, unfortunately, is not as simple as flipping a textbook. It is a complex socio-emotional process of interaction, action and reaction, reflection and consolidation. As a school, it is imperative that we create such opportunities to imbue our students with confidence – and we will continue to do so. 

    Primary education forms the foundation-building years, and arguably the most important years, for which skyscraper has stood if not for strong foundations? In building up our little skyscrapers, let’s work together in partnership, parents and school, to create a conducive, empowering, and encouraging learning environment for them.

        Here’s to a happy and healthy 2022!
