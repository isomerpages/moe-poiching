**2023 对培青学子的期许**

尊敬的家长们：

瞬息万变的世界促使教育也必须跟着转变，冠病疫情更是让改变加速，同时也为教育带来了新的景观。学习已不再局限于灌输语文数理的知识，而精通跨学科和跨文化所需的知识和技能更是不可或缺。学生的全能化，德智体群美这五育多元的发展将是现今教育的目标。
教育的目的不局限于传授知识与技能，教会学生如何“做事”，将来能够在社会上立足，并发展事业。教育更重要的目标其实是教会学生如何“做人”，帮助孩子们成为堂堂正正、品德高尚的人，不止有智商，还要有情商，将来才能为家庭、社会和国家做出贡献。随着大环境的日新月异，教育的要求也必然随之改变，培青的教育方式也要跟着革新，以确保我们的学生能够与时并进。

**忠孝节义 勤慎诚朴**

培青创办于百年前，历史洪流滚滚，老校能够历久弥新、屹立不倒，靠的是正面的办学方针和八字校训，让学校培育出一代又一代的优秀学子。

早在创校初期，“忠孝节义 勤慎诚朴”是学校的校训，后期转为学校的核心价值观。无论是校训或是价值观，这八字价值观确实清楚地阐述学校对培青学子的道德诉求。简单来说，我们希望孩子们懂得如何秉持原则来做事、做人。在未来的全球化和充斥着多元文化的社会，懂得如何坚守自己的原则来待人处事更显得重要。

为了更好地帮助孩子们了解并体现培青八字价值观，学校将在来年加强品德教育。以八字价值观为基础，刻意营造一个时时刻刻都提供学习机会让孩子们巩固对八字价值观的了解。

第一、 从2023年开始，学校将以八字价值观为班级命名，譬如：一勤一班、二诚一班等。

第二、八字价值观当中的“孝”与“节”具深远的意义，所谓“百行孝为先”，在学会如何与他人交流前，孩子们应该先懂得如何孝顺家中的长辈。“高风亮节”中的“节”指的是个人操守，孩子们的内心要正才能够很真挚地对待周围的人。我们希望每个孩子能将这两个价值观铭记在心，学校也会将重点关注这两个价值观，通过设计不同的学习体验，来帮助孩子们深入了解这两个价值观，并懂得将它们体现在日常生活以及待人处事中。

第三、学校也将重新设计八字价值观的学习活动，利用不同的平台，例如周会和班主任辅导课等等的时间来分享和讲解价值观，让孩子们有机会通过学习体验来亲身感受如何体现这些价值观。

有人说：孩子是一块璞玉，需要经过精心的雕琢，才会成为晶莹剔透的良玉。打磨璞玉磨去棱角和瑕疵，细心雕琢呈现美玉的品质，这有如灌输价值观予孩子们，让他们把其内在之美展现出来。再加上学习所授予的知识与技能，进一步帮助孩子们以智慧和仁心来了解和探索世界。

培养孩子是学校与家庭的共同责任，我们诚挚地邀请家长们与我们携手合作，一起协助孩子们成为玲珑透彩、晶莹润泽的美玉。

祝愿大家新的一年健康、快乐！

蔡颐龄校长


**Hopes for our Students in 2023**

Dear Parents

Education must adapt to the ever-changing dynamism of our world. As its silver lining, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated changes to and renewed the purpose of education. Learning is no longer limited to instilling knowledge of academic subjects but expanded to the knowledge and skills required for interdisciplinary and intercultural savvy. Yet the anchor for learning is constant – values and character. The holistic development of students in the social, moral, cognitive, physical and aesthetic domains remains the goal of today's education.

In education, the Knowing and Doing aspects of knowledge acquisition and practice are important in developing our students to become competent contributors to society. But also critical in education is the aspect of Being - for our students to not only have cognitive intelligence, but emotional and social intelligence as well, to be a positive source of influence in society. To that, Poi Ching is committed to prepare our students for the ever-changing world, to evolve and adapt our methods in guiding our students to become future-ready.

Poi Ching’s generations of graduates and its 100-year history are anchored on its sound school direction, dedicated educators, and the core values of **Loyalty, Filial Piety, Integrity, Justice, Diligence, Prudence, Sincerity, and Modesty.**

These eight values constitute the moral compass for our students as they brave the society. In the globalized and multicultural future, it is even more important to be principled in dealing with others, and our Core Values will guide our students to do so. To help our students better understand and embody the values, we will be strengthening moral education in the coming year. There will be greater intentionality in creating learning opportunities for pervasive reinforcement and consolidation of the understanding of our Core Values.

We begin with the structural element of naming our classes after our Core Values, to enhance the saliency of these values in the lived experiences of our students.

Among the eight Core Values, we will place greater emphasis on two integral values of **Filial Piety** and **Integrity**, and bring with it a host of learning experiences. In Chinese customs, filial piety is the epitome of morality, and we want all our students to embody this value in their relationship and interaction with the elders in their families. Integrity forms the moral compass that will guide our students to “always do the right thing”. With this focus in 2023, our students can look forward to learning experiences that will encourage them to put these values into action.

We will also be redesigning our learning activities in moral education, leveraging platforms such as Assembly and the Form Teacher Guidance period to engage our students in the values clarification process, for them to better understand and identify with our Core Values.

Analogous to a piece of jade in the rough, our students require dedicated carving, polishing, and care in their development to become the best versions of themselves. This process is equivalent to the inculcation of values. As with how the colour and quality of jade is enhanced with the stabilizing process, the introspection and character of our students is enhanced with the values inculcation process. Complemented with the knowledge and skills in learning, our students will be well-prepared to understand and explore the world.

Education remains a partnership and a journey that we are most fortunate to have you, our parents, on. Let us continue this journey this 2023 and make beautiful jades of our children!
