### Introduction

Chinese Calligraphy Club is established to promote Chinese Calligraphy in Poi Ching School. Weekly calligraphy classes are conducted for students to increase their Chinese Calligraphy proficiency.

**Learning Chinese Calligraphy can shape students’ character.**

***Diligence and Perseverance:***

Calligraphy is a fine art. Students need to focus, observe and analyze the characters’ structure carefully, then control their brushes to write the words. Calligraphy is the result of hard work. Students are required to persevere, overcome the difficulties and practise writing conscientiously.

***Modesty and Excellence:***

During competition, students have the opportunity to appreciate outstanding writings, as the Chinese saying goes “天外有天”, thus training the students to be &nbsp;humble and to strive for excellence.

Each year, we send members to various competitions organized by Chinese Calligraphy Society, Cluster Centre of Excellence (Chinese Cultural Arts), community clubs and schools.

The club also sent students’ calligraphy works to participate in exhibitions so as to provide students with more avenues to appreciate calligraphy. Students’ achievements are definitely something that the club takes pride in.
