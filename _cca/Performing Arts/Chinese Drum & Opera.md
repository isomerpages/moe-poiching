Our Chinese Drum and Opera CCA aims to promote and enhance the development of the unique traditional art-forms.

Through the CCA, student performers will learn various skills and have more opportunities to be immersed in these two art-forms. Ultimately, we strive to preserve this artistic cultural inheritance through driving this programme amongst our student performers.
