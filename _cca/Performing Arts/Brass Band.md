### Introduction

In January 2015, we had officially become a Brass Band in Poi Ching School. Under the new change, we participated under the ‘Brass Band’ category for SYF Arts Presentation in 2016, achieving the Certificate of Accomplishment under the new award system. Our current strong 48-member band have scheduled practices on Mondays and Thursdays, under the steadfast batonship of our conductor, Mr Aw Chye Hock. We also appreciate the continuous support, help and encouragement from our ever faithful, dedicated band alumni members who have contributed in every possible way.

Our band also performed during school functions and other external events outside school, where we were given ample opportunities to perform in the public. In April 2017, we performed in the Art Fiesta organised by OUR TAMPINES HUB, PAssionARTSC@Tampines and Pasir Ris Secondary School. Our 2017 year-end band camp was also organised not just to nurture music and aesthetics, but also to promote teamwork, leadership, friendship and belonging and spirit of service to the community. This year, we organised our school band exchange, where we invited two school bands from Hougang Primary school and Zhonghua Primary School. This band exchange provided ample opportunities for all band members to better hone their band skills and to interact with members from other schools’ bands. We participated in our recent SYF Arts Presentation under the ‘Brass Band’ category. With our hard work and dedication, our Poi Ching School Brass Band finally clinched the Certificate of Distinction. This would not be made possible without the support of the school, our band instructors, our band teachers and our dear parents.

Besides the continuous exposure for joy of learning and music-making, our band teachers also emphasised on the importance of character development of our band members. Our band members took part in the CCA Facilitation Session during Friday CCA curriculum time in April 2018, where they discussed about their strengths, weaknesses, areas of improvement, group dynamics and teamwork in their recent SYF Arts Presentation. Our band seniors also had an opportunity to coach the new P3 members in their band instrumental skills, which gradually built up their confidence in their leadership skills.

As Poi Ching School Brass Band continue to grow in strength and spirit, we look forward to more good years of exceptional band standards, dedication and discipline in our band music-making and performance.

### Important Information About Band Attendance

Please note that band attendance for all scheduled practices / performances is mandatory and important, as we emphasised on the importance of self-discipline and effort in every band member of our school. We also worked towards the importance of nurturing your child’s core values, social and emotional competencies and the emerging 21st&nbsp;Century competencies as from the 21st&nbsp;Century Competencies Framework in our education system. We value every band member’s contributions in his / her participation in the Band CCA, where they will gain invaluable exposure and experience in their route of music-making and musical development. We believe in the strong continuous partnership between the school, our stake-holders and our parents in ensuring our band members to contribute in their best for success in their CCA, as we worked tirelessly “Towards Excellence” in our school motto.

Please note that in the event of absences, request of early pickup or late arrival from CCA with valid reasons, a Parent’s / Guardian’s letter is required for submission to the Band Teacher OIC, Mdm Suryana. Subsequently, you may also notify via school’s official email. [Email:&nbsp;[suryana_buang@moe.edu.sg](mailto:suryana_buang@moe.edu.sg)]

**School Band Exchange 2018 with He Ming Wing Band (Zhengzhou, China) @ Poi Ching School**

On 27th&nbsp;July 2018, our Poi Ching School Brass Band warmly welcomed our fellow band performers from He Ming Wing Band from Zhengzhou, China on a Friday morning, where we were honoured to be part of the Singapore International Band Exchange (SIBF) 2018 organised by The Wind Bands Association of Singapore to showcase their band performers’ talents / skills at our school. The He Ming Wind Band was first established in March 2016 at Renhe Road Elementary School, where they instilled a sense of discipline and good temperament through music learning, cultivated a positive and enterprising outlook on life and explored potential musical interests and talents. This is our second school band exchange since our SYF band exchange in March this year, as other band teachers had also organised band exchanges in the previous years. This band exchange is a vital platform not just to showcase our band members’ talents / skills, but the invaluable experience and exposure gained from learning and listening from other overseas school bands in this meaningful event.

Our band members had the honour to listen to two of their performance repertoire, namely the “Black Forest Overture” by Michael Sweeney and “Stone Creek Episode” by Ed Huckeby at the Band Room. Our fellow band performers from He Ming Wind Band also had the opportunity to witness our brass band’s rehearsals for our annual National Day school celebrations at the parade square. At the end of the event, both school leaders exchanged the tokens of appreciation to commemorate this meaningful event. Our band members also shared group photo shots and appreciation gifts to our fellow band performers from He Ming Wind Band during the informal interaction time.

In conclusion, our band members have benefitted from the exposure of participating in this band exchange and they really enjoyed this wonderful and fulfilling experience together with the He Ming Wind Band performers.

**School Band Exchange 2018 @ Poi Ching School**

On 10th&nbsp;March 2018, our Poi Ching School Brass Band organised the school band exchange on a Saturday morning, where we had the honour to invite Punggol Primary School and Zhenghua Primary School to showcase their band members’ talents / skills at our school hall. It is our first school band exchange this year, as other band teachers had also organised band exchanges in the previous years. This band exchange is a vital platform not just to showcase our band members’ talents / skills, but the invaluable experience and exposure gained from learning and playing with other schools’ bands in this meaningful event.

We had two of our band members, Tabitha and Hilary to host this event as emcees, where they briefly introduced the participating school bands before their formal showcases on the school hall stage. Under the steadfast guidance of our band conductor Mr Aw, our band serenaded the audiences with the SYF set piece ‘Dare To Dream’ and their choice piece ‘Tempest’. The audiences enjoyed our band’s showcase very much. At the end of all band performances, the respective band conductors from both schools were all presented a certificate of appreciation and and a plush bear token by our PCS Brass Band OIC Mdm Suryana to commemorate this wonderful event. Our band members also shared group photo shots and hand-made personal SYF well-wishes cards with both schools’ band members during the informal interaction time.

During the finale, the three schools combined together to give a spirited, arousing performance of the SYF set piece ‘Dare To Dream’ at the hall stage, under the steadfast batonship of our band conductor Mr Aw. In conclusion, our band members have benefitted from the exposure of performing in a band exchange and they really enjoyed this wonderful and fulfilling experience altogether.
