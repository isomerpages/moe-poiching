### Introduction

In January 2015, we had officially become a Brass Band in Poi Ching School. Under the new change, we participated under the ‘Brass Band’ category for SYF Arts Presentation in 2016, achieving the Certificate of Accomplishment under the new award system. Our current strong 48-member band have scheduled practices on Mondays and Thursdays, under the steadfast batonship of our conductor, Mr Aw Chye Hock. We also appreciate the continuous support, help and encouragement from our ever faithful, dedicated band alumni members who have contributed in every possible way.

Our band also performed during school functions and other external events outside school, where we were given ample opportunities to perform in the public. In April 2017, we performed in the Art Fiesta organised by OUR TAMPINES HUB, PAssionARTSC@Tampines and Pasir Ris Secondary School. Our 2017 year-end band camp was also organised not just to nurture music and aesthetics, but also to promote teamwork, leadership, friendship and belonging and spirit of service to the community. This year, we organised our school band exchange, where we invited two school bands from Hougang Primary school and Zhonghua Primary School. This band exchange provided ample opportunities for all band members to better hone their band skills and to interact with members from other schools’ bands. We participated in our recent SYF Arts Presentation under the ‘Brass Band’ category. With our hard work and dedication, our Poi Ching School Brass Band finally clinched the Certificate of Distinction. This would not be made possible without the support of the school, our band instructors, our band teachers and our dear parents.

Besides the continuous exposure for joy of learning and music-making, our band teachers also emphasised on the importance of character development of our band members. Our band members took part in the CCA Facilitation Session during Friday CCA curriculum time in April 2018, where they discussed about their strengths, weaknesses, areas of improvement, group dynamics and teamwork in their recent SYF Arts Presentation. Our band seniors also had an opportunity to coach the new P3 members in their band instrumental skills, which gradually built up their confidence in their leadership skills.

As Poi Ching School Brass Band continue to grow in strength and spirit, we look forward to more good years of exceptional band standards, dedication and discipline in our band music-making and performance.

### Important Information About Band Attendance

Please note that band attendance for all scheduled practices / performances is mandatory and important, as we emphasised on the importance of self-discipline and effort in every band member of our school. We also worked towards the importance of nurturing your child’s core values, social and emotional competencies and the emerging 21st Century competencies as from the 21st Century Competencies Framework in our education system. We value every band member’s contributions in his / her participation in the Band CCA, where they will gain invaluable exposure and experience in their route of music-making and musical development. We believe in the strong continuous partnership between the school, our stake-holders and our parents in ensuring our band members to contribute in their best for success in their CCA, as we worked tirelessly “Towards Excellence” in our school motto.

Please note that in the event of absences, request of early pickup or late arrival from CCA with valid reasons, a Parent’s / Guardian’s letter is required for submission to the Band Teacher OIC, Mdm Suryana. Subsequently, you may also notify via school’s official email. [Email: [suryana_buang@moe.edu.sg](mailto:suryana_buang@moe.edu.sg)]
