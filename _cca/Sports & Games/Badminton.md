### Mission


Badminton CCA is one of the famous sports CCA in Poi Ching. There are about 100 pupils from P3 to P6. &nbsp;We encourage the players to take part in a variety of competition and friendly&nbsp;games.&nbsp;These&nbsp;exposure&nbsp;help the pupils to be more perseverant to face lifeâ€™s challenges. Debrief sessions after the games further enforce the school values such as modesty,&nbsp;integrity ,loyalty and&nbsp;excellence taught during CCA.
