### Introduction


Badminton CCA is one of the famous sports CCA in Poi Ching. There are about 100 pupils from P3 to P6.  We encourage the players to take part in a variety of competition and friendly games. These exposure help the pupils to be more perseverant to face life’s challenges. Debrief sessions after the games further enforce the school values such as modesty, integrity ,loyalty and excellence taught during CCA.
