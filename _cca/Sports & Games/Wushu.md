### Introduction

Wushu means Chinese martial arts. Throughout all these years, Wushu has developed from traditional Chinese martial arts to an athletic and aesthetic performance and competitive sport now. Speed, difficulty level as well as presentation are judged during competition.

Wushu helps to improve our children’s muscles and flexibility, concentration as well as the control over body and emotions resulting in better health and stamina. Wushu also aids in increasing the children’s motor skills, developing better hand to eye coordination. Our children will have a better sense of balance and become more agile. All of these can be achieved by training in drills, rhythmic movement and exercises.

Poi Ching School Wushu CCA was formed in year 2002. Presently, we have about 100 members inclusive of 30 school team members who are of National Inter-Primary School Wushu Championship capability. In addition, these school team members are also involved in several public performances. We also have a team of experienced and dedicated Wushu coaches training the pupils as well as preparing them for the annual Wushu Competition.

We believe in developing students’ character during the training, focusing on values like resilience, loyalty, respect and excellence. The coaches and teachers-in-charge always emphasizes on these values with the students through teachable moments and character development lessons in which we hold discussions on how we can instil these values in our everyday lives. The senior members of the team are also encouraged to be role models for their junior members to emulate and look up to. We aim to develop our students to be disciplined, humble and always striving for the best they can do.
