### Mission


A game of basketball is not just a simple game that involves a basketball, five players in each team and a basketball court. To play basketball well, we need more than just physical fitness and individual skills. We need commitment, discipline, teamwork, and sportsmanship. At PCS Basketball CCA, we do not just focus on coaching basketball skills but we also aim to install values and character.

A basketball game is a great teacher of life. It gives pupils an opportunity to win and lose together. It is through such experiences that pupils learn how to win with honour and to lose with dignity. As basketball is a team sport, teamwork is promoted amongst pupils who come from different classes and levels. An American basketball coach, Mike Krzyzewski, once compared a basketball team to the five fingers on our hand. Only when they come together, can they form a fist â€“ strong and united to overcome obstacles.
