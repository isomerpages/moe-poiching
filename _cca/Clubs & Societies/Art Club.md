**Introducing the Art Learning Wall**
-------------------------------------

The art club members were being briefed on the different artists. They are supposed to do art-making inspired by Nanyang artists, such Cheong Soo Pieng and Liu Kang. They explore the many possibilities of what Singapore could become in terms of the common living spaces and advancements to cater to the introspective and retrospective of modern and contemporary art.

### “P6 Farewell Gift” – Our Traditions

As a yearly traditions, the junior members will design and create a handmade gift for each and every one of our P6 members just before their final lapse into PSLE. Last year, they created a paper weight out of clay for the P6 graduating students.

### Past Year Activities

Appointed leaders in Primary 5 and 6 are given the opportunity to lead group members in 2D and 3D art projects like paper clay, wire-sculpting, origami, printmaking and reinventing masterpieces. After learning about master artists through group quizzes and stories, they lead their peers to brainstorm and critique their idea formulation and process before embarking on the team projects. After which, gallery walk are conducted to provide platforms for art appreciation. We also engage in art auction where members present each other’s work and try selling them to their targeted audience.

In addition, members will have the opportunities to go on learning journeys to art exhibitions such as to the Singapore Art Museums below, participate in nationwide art platforms like the Singapore Youth Festival and art camps in places like EZCOE and SOTA. Pupils are exposed to a myriad of art forms, which reflect the creative imagination and thoughtful expression of their peers. Moreover, through these exhibitions and competitions, pupils will learn about various art genres and this helps to promote the culture of learning and sharing among the young budding artists.
