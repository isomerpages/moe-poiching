### Introduction

The world is getting increasingly inter-connected.  In merely a few decades since the advent of the first computer, the speed of and reliance on computing has been growing exponentially over the years.  Smartphones, tablets and other gizmos are becoming increasingly ubiquitous.  Information and communication technology (ICT) has become the backbone of modern living.

The PCS InfoComm Club endeavors to nurture its members, guided by the school core values, to:

*   be at the forefront of technology;
*   to eventually write codes to solve problems in their studies, their lives, and even benefit society at large.

This year, 2020, we are embarking our kids to new area of Information communication Technology, which are Scratch Coding, Web Development skills and for the elder kids like P6 students, we are introducing them some AI knowledge and skills for kids.
