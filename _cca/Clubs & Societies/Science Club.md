### Introduction

The Science Club is an innovative and enterprising club. It aims to give our pupils learning experiences and exposure to the Life Sciences, Environmental Sciences and the Creative and Applied Sciences. Through an array of interesting activities, such as DNA extraction, toy-making and their designs, terrarium-making gardening and scientific experiments, we hope to cultivate a spirit of scientific inquiry and innovation in pupils.

### Key Programmes


**Life Science**

**DNA Extraction**

The ability to&nbsp;extract DNA&nbsp;is of primary importance to studying the genetic causes of disease and for the development of diagnostics and drugs. It is also essential for carrying out forensic science, sequencing genomes, detecting bacteria and viruses in the environment and for determining paternity.

Workshops were conducted to help students learn about the latest Life Sciences developments and to perform mini-experiments to extract DNA.

Community In Bloom

The Community in Bloom (CIB) programme by National Parks aims to foster a community spirit and bring together residents, both young and old, to make Singapore our garden. Through this programme, we hope to instil a love for horticulture in students with their engaging gardening activities and watch them become more involved in the school garden. This programme also encourages self-directed learning among students, helping them develop science process skills, project management skills, and teamwork and entrepreneurial skills.

Terrarium-making

Through making their own terrariums, students learn about the processes in the water cycle, such as evaporation and condensation. Through designing and building their terrariums, they are also able to express their creativity.

**Making terrarium (Environmental Science)**

Aquaponics

In 2017, the Science Club embarked on an aquaponics enrichment programme where they learnt how fishes and plants can depend on each other to survive happily. Pupils had the opportunity to rear fishes and grow edible vegetables indoors and at the same time, learn about sustainability and ownership. They even harvested Kang Kong which they could bring back to cook!

### Applied &amp; Creative Science

Toy-making and designing

Workshops were conducted to help students dream up fantastic toy ideas, unleash their creativity and build their very own toys. Members go through the process of self-discovery whilst inventing a unique toy in a supportive environment, helping them develop lateral thinking skills and confidence through their inventions.

**Toy Design Workshops – Magnetic Dancing Doll**

Science Learning Cards

The Science Club members also carry out the projects in the Science Learning Cards. Through the Learning Cards, they are given the opportunity to extend their learning of Science and exercise their creativity.
