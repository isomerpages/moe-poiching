### Introduction

Our regular brownies meetings are on Fridays during curriculum time. The guide leaders design varied activities to prepare the brownies for their tests and achievement badges. They are guided by the 5-point programme which develops them in 5 main areas: Personal &amp; Social Development, Home, Outdoor, Community and International. The girls display their leadership qualities when they take up appointments as Sixers and lead the brownies in group activities. The girls are constantly learning new skills and taking up challenges so as to equip and inspire them to be ready for their future.
