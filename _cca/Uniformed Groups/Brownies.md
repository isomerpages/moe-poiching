### Introduction

Girl Guide Singapore (GGS) (Brownies) has been providing us unparalleled opportunities for girls and women to discover and develop their strengths, their skills and their fullest potential to become responsible citizens of the world. Since the Girl Guide Movement began in Singapore in 1917, GGS has been delivering on the mission of building girls of courage, confidence and character, who make the world a better place.

Today GGS is the largest volunteer organisation for girls and women in Singapore. As a member of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS), we are connected to over 10 million members in 152 countries.

The girls are empowered through fun, challenging and unique experiences, adventures and activities. Equipping them to make a lasting positive impact by helping others. Our girls develop a deep sense of confidence and self-assurance, along with leadership and life skills - all while learning through fun adventure and making lifelong friendships.
