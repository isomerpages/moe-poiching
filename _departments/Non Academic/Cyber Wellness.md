Poi Ching School embarked on the Cyber Wellness (CW) journey with a goal in mind – to ensure all students are equipped with the relevant skills to navigate the cyber space responsibly and safely by the end of their primary school years. Our CW ambassadors are from Primary 4 and Primary 5 cohort. They undergo a 4-week training programme and learnt more about cyber wellness and ways to be a responsible advocate.

We continue to work on this goal by developing the curriculum and programmes in alignment with the MOE’s CW framework (Sense-Think-Act). The CW framework aims to develop the child’s instinct to protect and empower him to take responsibility for his own well-being in cyberspace.

### About the CW Framework (Sense-Think-Act)

The three principles, ‘**Respect for Self and Others**’, ‘**Safe and Responsible Use**’ and ‘**Positive Peer Influence**’ when adhered to will anchor a child’s well-being in cyberspace as he will then be able to make careful and well-considered decisions.

**Principles:**

1.  **Respect for Self and Others** <br>
    Students need to:
    *   uphold their own dignity when online (e.g. share appropriate content and participate in only legal online activities)
    *   respect other people online (e.g. put themselves in others’ shoes, accept diverse views and opinions, give credit when using other people’s work and seek permission where necessary, avoid sharing hurtful materials).
2.  **Safe and Responsible Use**  <br>
    Students need to:
    *   have an understanding of the risks of harmful and illegal online behaviour, and take steps to protect themselves (e.g. keep their personal information private, verify the reliability of information using various sources, take steps to avoid dangers they may encounter online).
    *   make wise and healthy choices (e.g. maintain a healthy balance of their online and offline activities)
3.  **Positive Peer Influence** <br>
    Students need to:
    *   be a positive role model online (e.g. share healthy and positive content, harness the affordances of technology to do good for society)
    *   advocate positive online behaviour (e.g. stand up for their peers online, report cases of cyber bullying to a trusted adult/authority, post encouraging remarks on social media)

### Curriculum

We arranged our curriculum based on our school’s tiered system that encompasses and benefits all students.

**Tier 1: All Students**

Students will undergo Cyber Wellness lessons during the From Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP). The lessons are tiered according to their level. Assembly programmes are also conducted by vendors who are experts in this field. By the end of their primary school years, students will have covered the Cyber Wellness curriculum and will be responsible digital users.

**Tier 2: Cyber Wellness Ambassadors**

The Cyber Wellness Ambassadors will undergo trainings throughout the year to ensure they are well-equipped with skills to advocate and share their knowledge on Cyber Wellness. They will have opportunities to exercise their leadership and advocacy through student run events.

**Tier 3: Outreach to Parents**

We continue our outreach to parents/guardians of our students through the cyber wellness lessons (child and parent activities), newsletters and SLS assigned lessons. Our aim is to work with parents and students to ensure we speak a common language in Cyber Wellness.

**Tier 4: Working with Students in Need**

We work closely with the school counsellor to render assistance to students in need. Together, we go navigate the problems at hand and guide them to make better choices.
