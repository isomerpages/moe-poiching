### Main Pedagogy/Teaching Strategies

![](/images/main-pedagogy_teaching.png)

The Arts is integral to the holistic development of our children. It contributes to their development of an understanding of the physical, emotional, intellectual, aesthetic, social, moral and spiritual dimensions of human experience. The role of arts education is central in developing in our children a lively curiosity and an inquisitive mind. This is essential as it promotes inventive thinking and an innovative orientation in what they do. According to Bloom’s Revised Taxonomy, creativity is the highest rung of the cognitive ladder. Arts practitioners form original thoughts, create original works, and share the knowledge of their own creativity on a daily basis.

One of our main pedagogy which cuts across the Art and Music curriculum is i-Play, i-Learn, i-Innovate. We are all are cognizant of the positive effects of play. Playing, after all  comes naturally to children. We have all seen how children very naturally learn as they engaged in play. Through play they develop their social and cognitive skills, mature emotionally, and gain the self-confidence required to engage in new experiences and environments. In Poi Ching, the students learn to make sense of the world around them through play and through that learning, they can start to create and innovate.

 In Poi Ching, we also hope to provide an enriching broad-based experience for our students and have planned these authetic art experiences to compliment our curriculum:

### Key Programmes


**Visual Art**

The Visual Art Curriculum is structured based on Art Forms as we want to give our students the exposure to a wide variety of art forms so that they can explore and discover their interests. Students are also taught Art Theory such as the Elements and Principles of Design as well as Feldman’s approach to art criticism so that students have the vocabulary and skills discuss artworks.

The Music Curriculum is structured to provide our students with the opportunity to explore a wide range of instruments and learn to use these instruments to express and communicate.  Principles of music specific pedagogies such as Kodaly, Dalcroze and Orff are also used in the teaching of music concepts. In Poi Ching, our students also develop an awareness and appreciation of local and global cultures through music.
