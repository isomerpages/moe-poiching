### Main Pedagogy/Teaching Strategies

![](/images/main-pedagogy_teaching.png)

The Arts is integral to the holistic development of our children. It contributes to their development of an understanding of the physical, emotional, intellectual, aesthetic, social, moral and spiritual dimensions of human experience. The role of arts education is central in developing in our children a lively curiosity and an inquisitive mind. This is essential as it promotes inventive thinking and an innovative orientation in what they do. According to Bloom’s Revised Taxonomy, creativity is the highest rung of the cognitive ladder. Arts practitioners form original thoughts, create original works, and share the knowledge of their own creativity on a daily basis.

One of our main pedagogy which cuts across the Art and Music curriculum is i-Play, i-Learn, i-Innovate. We are all are cognizant of the positive effects of play. Playing, after all &nbsp;comes naturally to children. We have all seen how children very naturally learn as they engaged in play. Through play they develop their social and cognitive skills, mature emotionally, and gain the self-confidence required to engage in new experiences and environments. In Poi Ching, the students learn to make sense of the world around them through play and through that learning, they can start to create and innovate.

&nbsp;In Poi Ching, we also hope to provide an enriching broad-based experience for our students and have planned these authetic art experiences to compliment our curriculum:

### Key Programmes


**Visual Art**

The Visual Art Curriculum is structured based on Art Forms as we want to give our students the exposure to a wide variety of art forms so that they can explore and discover their interests. Students are also taught Art Theory such as the Elements and Principles of Design as well as Feldman’s approach to art criticism so that students have the vocabulary and skills discuss artworks.

**Music**

The Music Curriculum is structured to provide our students with the opportunity to explore a wide range of instruments and learn to use these instruments to express and communicate. &nbsp;Principles of music specific pedagogies such as Kodaly, Dalcroze and Orff are also used in the teaching of music concepts. In Poi Ching, our students also develop an awareness and appreciation of local and global cultures through music.

### To our Learning For Life Programme (LLP):

**Learning for Life Programme – D’ARTS@PCS 3E Framework:**

![](/images/LLP.jpg)

D’ARTS@PCS aims to help students:  <br>
D – Discover strengths and interests  <br>
‘&nbsp; – (The apostrophe is used to indicate possession of the Arts by the students)  <br>
A – Acquire a sense of empathy and care  <br>
R – Respect diversity and appreciate our multi-cultural heritage  <br>
T – To develop artistic expression  <br>
S – Sharpen their social skills

In line with the aims of LLP to broaden and deepen the learning of our students to prepare them for life, our LLP leverages on the vibrant Arts culture in Poi Ching and expand the number of opportunities and platforms for moulding the character of students through a wider scope of musical and performing arts experiences. D’ARTS@PCS builds upon existing platforms and processes such as the PCS Arts Education framework, General Music Programme, Visual and Performing Arts CCA and PAL, and takes into consideration our school’s unique culture and resources.

Being an SAP school means that our students have fewer opportunities to mix with students from other races and may also not be as familiar with other cultures compared with students from mainstream schools. An exposure to varied programmes from different cultural groups heightens cultural awareness and instils respect and tolerance for diversity. Values and attitudes acquired through experiential learning are likely to sink deeper than those learnt in the classroom. Being a Dance niche school, we are also equipped with 2 dance rooms which we hope to continue to fully utilized with our proposed LLP.

### Exposure: Broad-Based Curriculum for All

Under the broad-based curriculum, all students go through an enhanced Music and Performing Arts modules. These modules are carefully selected in a deliberate attempt to promote social cohesion through the appreciation of our multi-cultural society. They are also selected for their ability to provide students with real-life experiential learning to develop their character and values, cultivate positive attitudes, self-expression and strengthen their people skills. During the art and music curriculum, students will also be taught a modified version of Feldman’s Method of Critical Inquiry. These are a set of effective questioning strategies to initiate verbal interaction that encourages reasoning, critical thinking resulting in positive learning outcomes.

### Experience: Authentic Experiences for Many

**Assembly Talks and Enrichments**

Under authentic experiences, we bring in high quality arts performances during assembly. Lower primary students will also have Performing Arts CCA workshops such as Introduction to Band and Chinese Orchestra. Performing Arts CCA also incorporate different cultural elements into their 30 week CCA program. For example, that can include cultural specific pieces/works in the repertoire that students learn in their CCA. The first-hand experience of learning, interpreting, improvising, presenting and performing a culturally different piece will allow students to delve deeper into the historical and cultural context of a specific culture.

**Performing Arts CCA**

All the Performing Arts modules culminate into a performance at the end of each term during the Aesthetics week or during school events. Venues such as the stage in the library, dance rooms, art gallery, school hall will be opened to the students for various arts events/ performances. The Performing Arts CCA leaders will also be given the opportunity to plan and spearhead the Aesthetics week and assembly showcases. Students who have been identified to have an aptitude or an interest can book a slot to perform to their friends during the 3 recesses. Ultimately, such student led projects will serve as an excellent platform for the Performing Arts CCA leaders to exercise their leadership skills, improve on relationship management and confidence building.

**Authentic Learning Journeys**

For the P4-P6 students, we have arranged for them to go on authentic learning journeys to various arts related venues for an aesthetic experience. An integral part of these learning journeys is the understanding of what concert/museum etiquette entails. Concert/Museum etiquette refers to a set of polite behaviour expected of concert goers/visitors. To make the experience more meaningful, teachers will provide more in-depth information about the art forms the students are experiencing so that they can see the relevance in the real world. Pre and post activities will also be conducted so as to gather feedback for review and to consolidate the students’ learning after the visit.

### Excellence: Talent Development for Some

In the final tier of D’ARTS@PCS, we cater to the needs of high achievers in the Arts. The exceptional talents in Performing Arts will be identified for external talent development programmes organised by various Arts organisations (SOTA, NAC, WBAS) and MOE-CCAB (MTDC). This provides students with opportunities to train with the best of the best. As iron sharpens iron, the takeaways from this specialised talent programmes are invaluable to the special few.

We also require these high achievers to do service learning, integrating meaningful community service with instruction and reflection to enrich the learning experience, teach civic responsibility, and strengthen communities. Given their talent, these students should not stop at product, but to use their talent to bless the community. Their annual projects will be focused on service to community, through charity showcases/ productions/ exhibitions to bring joy to the young, old or less fortunate.

### Our Dept Events (2018)

### 2nd&nbsp;Music Aesthetics Week 2018 @ Poi Ching School

The Aesthetics Department continued with the series of music performances during the three recesses at the Library Stage (Level 3) on 29th&nbsp;August 2018 (Wednesday) during the last week of Term 3. Our department continued to leverage on our school’s Student Leadership training that we had conducted for our music monitors at the start of the year. Our focus of nurturing the leadership attributes of our music monitors will continue, where they will learn to take up roles and responsibilities assigned to them. Two of our newest emcees, Guo Pinshuo and Faith Chow from 5F are given the opportunity to hone their public speaking skills in front of the audiences at the Library Stage. They will also share about their positive experiences of public speaking during the Music Aesthetics Week event in a short video. We have also invited some of our pupil performers to share about their personal experiences of performing in front of the audiences during the Music Aesthetics Week event in a short video.

### Music Aesthetics Week 2018 @ Poi Ching School

The Aesthetics Department had organised a series of music performances during the three recesses at the Library Stage (Level 3) on 7th&nbsp;(Wednesday) and 8th&nbsp;March 2018 (Thursday) during the last week of Term 1. This event is a vital platform not just to showcase our pupils’ musical talents and skills, but the invaluable experience and exposure gained from playing and performing in front of audiences. Leveraging on the Student Leadership training that we had conducted for our music monitors at the start of the year, we are moving into the direction of nurturing the leadership attributes of our music monitors, where they will learn to take up roles and responsibilities assigned to them. For our first showcase at the Library Stage, our selected music monitors are exposed to the roles and responsibilities of ushering pupils into the performance venue, fetching the performers, displaying concert etiquette placards at the audiences and emcee-ing during the events. Our four girls, Velencia (3E), Kaylee (4D), Estrella and Bianca (6C) are given the opportunity to hone their public speaking skills in front of the audiences at the Library Stage.

We had also invited our Year Heads, Mrs Jeanette Tan, Ms Joanna Tan and Mdm Saadah to present the certificates and tokens of appreciation to our performers on stage. At the end of our event, our respective Year Heads were all presented with the commemorative Aesthetics Week event poster as a token of appreciation for their support in this meaningful event. One of our emcees, Estrella (6C) shared about her positive experiences of public speaking during the Music Aesthetics Week event in a short video. Many of our performers’ peers have come to support them at the Library Stage during the two-day event. In conclusion, our performers have benefitted from the exposure of performing in front of audiences and they have really enjoyed this wonderful and fulfilling experience altogether.

**Music Elective Programme (MEP) Outreach Event at National Gallery Singapore 2017**

On 4th&nbsp;March 2017, some of our P5-P6 pupils attended the Music Elective Programme (MEP) Outreach Event organised by the Arts Education Branch (Student Development Curriculum Branch, MOE) on a Saturday afternoon at National Gallery Singapore. This outreach event is a platform for MEP students from secondary schools and junior colleges to engage the primary school audience in their musical learning. Also, the primary school pupils have the opportunity to learn more about what MEP is at the secondary school level.

Our pupils had an interesting hands-on session during the rhythmic improvisation workshop at the Rooftop Studio conducted by the MEP students from Anglo-Chinese School (Independent). Subsequently, they had watched a number of solo and ensemble live performances on classical music from various MEP secondary schools and junior colleges at the Padang Atrium and the Singapore Courtyard. The pupil participants were also given a brief guided tour of the art exhibition featuring&nbsp;_Art in Singapore since the 19th&nbsp;century_&nbsp;at National Gallery Singapore. In conclusion, our pupils gained insightful fulfilment from their participation in this outreach event.

**Art Assembly Programme by Art Outreach 2016**

During the Art assembly programme, Art Outreach presenters took the Lower Primary pupils on a journey to explore Singapore’s history through artworks by Liu Kang and Ho Kok Hoe. Pupils were actively involved in the stories behind people, places and events that inspired the artworks through dramatization, games and discussions facilitated by the presenters. Through exploring artworks by the local artists, pupils developed an understanding of Singapore’s history and also an appreciation for our cultural diversity.

**Primary 4 Aesthetics Learning Journey 2016**

As part of the broad-based art experience under the Aesthetics Department, the school organized a learning journey for the Primary 4 pupils to attend a Chinese Musical Drama &lt; The Legend of Monkey King &gt; on the 28th July 2016. This production draws inspiration from the famous classical Chinese novel  and aims to raise the interest of our pupils in learning Chinese language and culture. We hope that this authentic theatre experience will help to nurture a lifelong love and appreciation of the Arts.

**Aesthetics Week (Term 3) 2016**

For Aesthetic Week this term, the P1 to P4 dropped by the art gallery during their recesses for some Lego fun. As they enter the gallery, they picked up some Lego blocks and built something for the Poi Ching School Lego Garden. Pupils are free to add a flower, an insect, a little creature or anything they can imagine and create, to help make the garden come alive.
