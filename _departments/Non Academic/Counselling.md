### What is counselling?

Counselling is a safe and comfortable space where pupils can share about their thoughts and feelings in a non-judgmental environment. The school counsellor works together with the pupils to manage their social, emotional and behavioural issues.

### Who may benefit from counselling?

Pupils who face social, emotional and/or behavioural issues may request to speak to the school counsellor. At times, referrals are made by year heads, teachers or parents if they feel that specialised intervention is required. Parent consent will be obtained before the first counselling session. Examples of counselling issues include (but are not limited to) peer relationship problems, grief and loss, examination stress, anger management and anxiety issues.

### What happens during counselling?

During the first few sessions, the school counsellor will build rapport with the pupil and gather information of the presenting issue. From then on, the school counsellor will work with the pupils in managing the issue by teaching coping skills, sharing problem-solving strategies, provide psychoeducation and facilitating pupils’ self-reflection.

If the school counsellor ascertains that the pupil requires more intensive intervention, she may refer the case to professional agencies such as REACH and Family Services Centres for their necessary action.
