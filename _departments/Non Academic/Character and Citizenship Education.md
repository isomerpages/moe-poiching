**Commemorating World Mental Health Day**

![](/images/Slide1-4.jpg)

**World Mental Health Day**&nbsp;is an initiative by World Health Organisation. It is observed globally on&nbsp;**10 October every year**&nbsp;with the aims of raising awareness of mental health issues and synergising efforts to promote positive mental well-being. Poi Ching School supports the global World Mental Health Day initiative this October by focusing on Positive Emotions and Positive Relationships with the theme of&nbsp;_**“Do Good, Feel Good, Spread Good”**_.

We encourage our students to recognise and exercise their strengths, build on positive emotions like hope, compassion, gratitude and pride, as well as to actively contribute to their family and community. With a virtuous cycle of positive relationships reinforcing their experiences of positive emotions, this not only helps to strengthen their resilience and stress coping capacity, but also enhances their mental well-being. The attached video and slides provide some ways to put to practice positive well-being.
