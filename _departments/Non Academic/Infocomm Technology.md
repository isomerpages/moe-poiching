During the Code for Fun programme, P6 students learnt the following:

*   Computational Thinking and how it can be applied to other aspects of the students’ lives
*   Basic programming concepts such as events, loops, variables and functions were taught to the students
*   Develop logical thinking and problem-solving skills by breaking down problems into bite-sizes
*   Promote collaboration through small group peer-learning. They also got a chance to work together to program a dance using their Sphero robotic kits!
*   Students ended off the 10-hour session with an introduction to Artificial intelligence

### ICT Mentors

Our ICT Mentors lead in the use of ICT tools in their lessons and conduct professional sharing with other staff to cultivate the use of ICT in teaching and learning. During Circuit Breaker in 2020, our ICT Mentors played a pivotal role in upskilling all teachers to facilitate the implementation of Full Home-Based Learning.

In 2021, our ICT Mentors continue to provide professional development for all staff via SLS.

1.  1.  As part of its commitment to nurturing future-ready learners, the Ministry of Education had announced that all students in Singapore schools will be supported in their learning by the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS), an online learning platform that contains curriculum-aligned resources and learning tools.
    2.  With the SLS, students will be able to learn better through the use of technology. Students will be able to learn anytime, anywhere, and at their own pace, whether independently or with their peers. Teachers will also be able to use the SLS to complement their classroom teaching, further enriching students’ learning experience.
    3.  Our teachers will guide your child in activating the SLS account and using the learning platform.
    4.  We look forward to your support as we help our students strengthen their learning through the SLS.
