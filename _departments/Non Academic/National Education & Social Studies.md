**Total Defence Day 2018 – Together We Keep Singapore Strong**

This year, Total Defence Day falls on the eve of Chinese New Year. It serves as a poignant reminder to us not to take our peace for granted and let apathy and complacency lull us into a false sense of security.

Here are some pictures of the various activities taking place to commemorate Total Defence Day. Remember, everyone has a part to play!
