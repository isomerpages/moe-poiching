### Vision

Students with a sense of belonging to the family, school, nation and world

### Mission

Inculcate in students the knowledge, skills and values to develop into concerned and engaged citizens


### Key Programmes

**National Education (NE) Commemorative Days**

Apart from the structured Character and Citizenship Education classes, the four NE Commemorative Days (Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day, and National Day) play a vital role in shaping students' learning experiences in school. These NE commemorative days allow students to gain valuable lessons from significant moments in Singapore's history and reflect on how they can apply what they have learnt as concerned and engaged citizens.
