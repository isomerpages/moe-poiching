**P1 Library Orientation**

P1 library Orientation programme was conducted by our librarian. The objective of this programme is to introduce the students to the school library and to orientate the students to the rules and regulations of the library. Students were also given an MRL card for them to use when borrowing books from the library. The students were then given a tour of the library by the librarian.

**Civica Reading Programme**

Thematic Displays are displayed in the library during the different themes of the different levels. These served to encourage and stimulate the students to participate in the activities and to learn more about the different themes. Most of the activities are interactive and students had to find out the answers to the quizzes or puzzles from the information given at the thematic displays.

**Storytelling @Recess**

Storytelling @ Recess is conducted once monthly during the three recesses. Students come to the library to listen to the different stories that are told by the teachers in the school.  A variety of storytelling strategies are being used to woo the students to listen the stories. Examples are reading from the big books, story books, watching excerpts of movies from story books and on online stories. Participation from the students had been very encouraging, especially from the lower primary students.

**‘Read n Glow’ skit by Readers House**

Reader’s House presented an English skit as a Post-Examination activity for the Lower Primary students.  Students were exposed to a variety of English idioms and phrases during the skit. Students were also given opportunities to take part in a quiz and to take pictures with the main character of the show, Geronimo Stilton.

**‘Books To Go’ Activity**

‘Books to Go’ activity was conducted by the Tampines NLB during the English Week. The booth was set up in the canteen. Students were scheduled to come down to the canteens to borrow the books that were brought over to the school by the members of the NLB. Students were excited as they were given the opportunity to borrow books from the NLB without having to go to NLB.

**Prizes for Top Readers**
