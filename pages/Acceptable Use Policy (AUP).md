<h2>ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY (AUP) AGREEMENT<br><strong>on use of digital devices and Edtech resources</strong></h2>
<p>All Poi Ching SAPlings must strive to be future-ready, responsible learners
who can lead self and lead others. We have to be aware of our responsibilities

that everyone has a safe, conducive online learning experience, please
abide by the following guidelines.</p>

authorised to.</p>
</li>

<p>I understand that the use of learning devices and school’s EdTech resources
should solely be for the purpose of learning.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Being a Responsible Digital Citizen</h3>

<p>make threats, cause harassment or embarrassment, impersonate or intimidate
others.</p>
